Thank you all for visiting my blog. Today, I am excited to introduce some showcases demonstrating how my team and I have enhanced the image quality of Stable Diffusion. Additionally, I'm pleased to share that we have significantly improved Stable Diffusion's text generation capabilities within images, achieving both beauty and stability.

Our current research is being applied to develop an image-generating product that automatically creates ads from product URLs. Below are some of our showcases.
